Operator Overloading:

Operator overloading in Python allows the same operator to have different meanings depending on the context of its usage. It is achieved by defining special methods in a class that correspond to the operator being overloaded.

Unary Operator Overloading:

Unary operators work with a single operand.
They are defined using special methods in a class with names like __neg__ for unary minus, __pos__ for unary plus, __abs__ for absolute value, __invert__ for bitwise negation, etc.

Unary operators include:

Unary plus (+)
Unary minus (-)
Logical NOT (!)
Bitwise NOT (~)

For example:

class MyClass:
    def __neg__(self):
        # Define behavior for unary minus
        pass

Binary Operator Overloading:

Binary operators work with two operands.
They are defined using special methods in a class with names like __add__ for addition, __sub__ for subtraction, __mul__ for multiplication, __truediv__ for division, __mod__ for modulus, etc.

Binay operators include:

Arithmetic operators: 

 (+)(-)(*)
 (/)
 (**)
 (%)
 (//)
Comparison operators:

 (==)
 (!=)
 (<)
 (>)
 (<=)
 (>=)
Bitwise operators:

 (&)
 (|)
 (^)
 (<<)
 (>>)
For example:

class MyClass:
    def __add__(self, other):
        # Define behavior for addition
        pass
