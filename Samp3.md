NumPy:

Concept: NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
Key Features:
Arrays for efficient numerical computing.
Mathematical operations and functions.
Broadcasting for implicit looping.
Linear algebra support.
Pandas:

Concept: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are built on top of NumPy arrays, along with methods for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Key Features:
DataFrame for structured data manipulation.
Handling missing data and alignment.
Versatile data manipulation methods.
Time series support.
Matplotlib:

Concept: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and charts to visualize data in various formats.
Key Features:
Flexible plotting functions.
Customization options for plots.
Exporting plots to various formats.
Easy integration with other libraries.

Correlation Coefficient: It's a measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.

Groupby in Pandas: It's a powerful function that allows you to split the data into groups based on some criteria, apply a function to each group independently, and then combine the results back into a DataFrame. In this exercise, we used groupby to group the data by 'Customer_ID' and 'Product_Name', and then applied aggregation functions like 'sum' and 'mean'.

Visualization: Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python. We used it to create various types of plots like bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to visualize the data and gain insights.

The concept and theory for each part of the Program:

a) Data Loading and Exploration:

Concept: Descriptive statistics provide insights into the basic characteristics of a dataset, such as measures of central tendency, variability, and distribution.
Syntax:
//Loading dataset into Pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

//Descriptive statistics with Pandas
data.describe()

//Descriptive statistics with NumPy
np.describe(data)

//Displaying first few rows
data.head()
b) Data Cleaning and Manipulation:

Concept: Handling missing values and converting data types are essential steps in preparing the dataset for analysis.
Syntax:
//Checking for missing values
data.isnull().sum()

//Converting 'Date' column to datetime object
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

//Creating new column 'Total_Price'
data['Total_Price'] = data['Quantity'] * data['Price_per_Unit']

c) Data Visualization:

Concept: Visualization helps in understanding patterns and relationships within the data.
Syntax:
//Bar chart showing total sales for each product
product_sales.plot(kind='bar')

//Line chart for sales trend over time
sales_over_time.plot(kind='line')

//Scatter plot to explore relationship between variables
plt.scatter(data['Quantity'], data['Total_Price'])

d) Advanced Analysis:

Concept: Advanced analysis involves calculating statistical measures and performing group-wise operations.
Syntax:
//Calculating correlation coefficient
np.corrcoef(data['Quantity'], data['Total_Price'])

//Grouping data and finding average spending per customer
data.groupby('Customer_ID')['Total_Price'].mean()

//Identifying top products by total sales
data.groupby('Product_Name')['Total_Price'].sum().nlargest(5)

Aim: 
To create a Python program for analyzing sales transactions dataset, including data loading, exploration, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and advanced analysis using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Algorithm:

Import Libraries:

Import pandas (pd), numpy (np), and matplotlib.pyplot (plt).
Load and Explore Data:

Load the dataset into a DataFrame (df) using pd.read_csv().
Print descriptive statistics with df.describe() and display the first few rows with df.head().
Data Cleaning and Manipulation:

Check for missing values with df.isnull().sum().
Convert 'Date' column to datetime format using pd.to_datetime().
Calculate 'Total_Price' by multiplying 'Quantity' and 'Price_per_Unit'.
Data Visualization:

Group data by 'Product_Name' and plot total sales for each product as a bar chart.
Group data by 'Date' and plot sales trend over time as a line chart.
Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'Quantity' and 'Total_Price'.
Advanced Analysis:

Calculate correlation coefficient between 'Quantity' and 'Total_Price' using np.corrcoef().
Find average spending per customer by grouping data by 'Customer_ID' and calculating mean 'Total_Price'.
Identify top 5 products based on total sales using product_sales.nlargest(5).
Display Visualization:

Use plt.show() to display each plot.

Result:
Thus the Python program for analyzing sales transactions dataset, including data loading, exploration, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and advanced analysis using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib has been executed successfully.
