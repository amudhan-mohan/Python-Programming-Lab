Aim:
To create a Python program that reads numerical data from a file, performs calculations, and handles potential errors gracefully.

Algorithm:
Define a function to read numerical data from a file.
Open the specified file, iterating through each line.
Attempt to convert each line to a float, appending valid values to a list.
Handle potential errors, such as a missing file or invalid data formats.
Perform numerical calculations on the collected data.
Handle potential errors during calculations, like division by zero.
Print the total and average if calculations are successful.
Provide clear feedback to the user throughout the process.

Result:
Thus the Python program for numerical data analysis and error handling has been executed successfully.
